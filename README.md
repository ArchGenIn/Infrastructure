# Infrastructure
This repository contains the code and configuration files used to build and manage the cloud infrastructure for the Institute of Archaeogenomics. It uses Terraform, CloudInit, and Ansible to automate deployment and setup. The infrastructure provisions an HTCondor cluster and installs components of [PAPline](https://github.com/ArchGenIn/papline) short read alignment pipeline.
